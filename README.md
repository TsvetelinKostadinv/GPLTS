# General Purpouse library from Tsvetelin

### What is this library all about
Well this is a compilation of all utility functions I have used in my projects. As I see it is very likely that I'll use them again, so I *think to myself what a wonderful world*.. ahem... so I said to myself why don't I collect it in a package for easier use. Maybe I'll split it in the future when it gets sufficiently large, but at this moment it is not of high priority.

### Main goal
It is to promote a more functional style when programming in Java. Although it is a very old language it has very little if any options for functional programming. You can find various utilities in the packages for file creation, lazy evaluation and many, many more.
